# My About Me Page
My favorite hobby is **basketball**.
I got interested in basketball in 7th grade, when there was a *basketball tournament* happening in P.E. and my team did not do well, so I wanted to do whatever it takes to get **better**.
I spend a lot of time on basketball because I play it in **P.E.** in school and I practice at **home**.
I enjoy **shooting** the most in basketball because it is fun and satisfying when the net makes a swish sound after the ball perfectly goes in.
I learned that in order to be a pro in basketball, you need a lot of **dribbling moves** and be good at **shooting**. 
A fun fact about basketball is that I learned how to shoot better yesterday because I learned a new shooting form at home from practicing a lot.
